# Changelog

## [0.3.2](https://github.com/HexRweb/GhostHunter-server/compare/v0.3.1...v0.3.2)

 - Fixes:
  - `includePages` will now include pages (what a novel idea!) in the index
  - The frontend map file will be useful from now on (the contents weren't persisted, which is apparently important!)
